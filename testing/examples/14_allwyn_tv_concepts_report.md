## Sample Responses

### uk_f_01 (24y, F, United Kingdom, Undergraduate degree)

**want_to_know_more** (2.36):
> "Honestly, not really. The scenes feel a bit generic and corporate - like every other company advert I've seen. The "best of both worlds" messaging doesn't tell me anything specific about what makes Allwyn different or why I'd actually want to work there. It's all quite vague and doesn't grab my a..."

**memorability** (2.63):
> "I'd say Concept 1 is somewhat memorable, mainly because of the contrasting "startups vs big firms" angle and the energetic visuals. The Allwyn branding with the tagline "a winning career awaits" does stick a bit, but honestly there's quite a lot going on across all those scenes - it feels a bit b..."

### uk_m_04 (24y, M, United Kingdom, Undergraduate degree)

**want_to_know_more** (2.42):
> "Honestly, not really. The whole "startups vs big firms" comparison feels a bit generic and corporate-y to me. The messaging about "best of both worlds" and working across a global network doesn't really tell me what makes Allwyn actually different or interesting as a place to work - it's just typ..."

**memorability** (3.01):
> "I'd say Concept 1 is reasonably memorable, yeah. The contrast between the chaotic startup vibe and the stable big firm environment is pretty clear, and that Allwyn logo with the tagline at the end sticks with you. It's not groundbreaking or anything, but it gets the point across in a way that you..."

### gr_f_07 (27y, F, Greece, Doctorate)

**want_to_know_more** (2.82):
> "Not really, to be honest. The scenes feel quite generic - just typical office environments and corporate messaging that could be for any company. As someone with a doctorate, I'd want to see something more specific about the actual work, research opportunities, or what makes this company intellec..."

**memorability** (2.62):
> "Looking at Concept 1, I find it somewhat generic honestly. The scenes blend together - office spaces, people chatting, corporate environments - it's all quite standard workplace imagery that I've seen in countless other ads. Nothing really stands out or sticks with me in a way that would make me ..."

### gr_m_10 (38y, M, Greece, Doctorate)

**want_to_know_more** (2.41):
> "Not particularly, to be honest. The concept feels quite generic - it's just showing typical office environments and people working, which doesn't really differentiate this company from any other workplace. As someone with a doctorate who values intellectual challenge and meaningful work, I'd need..."

**memorability** (2.41):
> "Looking at Concept 1, I find it somewhat generic and forgettable to be honest. The juxtaposition of startups versus big firms is a familiar trope, and while the visuals are professional, nothing really stands out or sticks with me. The messaging about "best of both" and global networks feels like..."

### cz_f_13 (31y, F, Czech Republic, Undergraduate degree)

**want_to_know_more** (2.25):
> "Honestly, not really. The concept feels a bit generic with the typical office scenes and motivational messaging about "best of both worlds." I'd need to see something more specific about what actually makes this company different - like their culture, benefits, or what they actually do - before I..."

**memorability** (2.49):
> "Looking at Concept 1, I'd say it's somewhat memorable but not particularly striking. The variety of office scenes and the "best of both" messaging creates some visual interest, but honestly it feels a bit generic - like many other corporate recruitment or career platform ads I've seen. The Allwyn..."
